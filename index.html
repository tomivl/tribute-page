          <h2 class="sub"> Who is Darwin? </h2>
          <p>
        Charles Darwin is, perhaps, the most important biologist in history. With his research, he questioned the divine origin of life that religion proposed and tried to find a scientific explanation for why living things are the way they are. </p>
        <p> Thanks to him, life is a slightly less puzzling mystery.</p>
          <h2 class="sub">
            Biography of Charles Darwin (1809-1882)</h2>
          <p>
        Charles Darwin was an English naturalist who published one of the most influential scientific works in the world of biology: "The Origin of Species." In it, he laid the foundations of evolution, a process that is possible thanks to what he called natural selection.</p>
          <h3 class="sub">Early years</h3>
          <p>
        Charles Robert Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, England, on February 12, 1809, into a family of scientists. In fact, both his father and grandfather were renowned doctors from this small town in the county of Shropshire, near Wales.</p>
          <p>Esta influencia científica hizo que Darwin se interesara por el mundo de la biología ya desde una muy temprana edad. Coleccionaba minerales, conchas y otros objetos que encontraba y los estudiaba, algo poco común para un niño</p>
          <p>When he was a teenager, his father, Robert Darwin, pushed him to study medicine. For this reason, in October 1825, Charles Darwin entered the University of Edinburgh to pursue this career. In any case, as he had not decided, Darwin did not feel comfortable and did not want to continue studying, so he ended up leaving Medicine.</p>
          <p>Upon leaving university, he began, again on the advice of his father, an ecclesiastical career in 1828 at Christ’s College, Cambridge, one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in England.</p>
          <p>
        Although, again, he continued without integrating or becoming passionate about what he was studying, it was in Cambridge where he discovered his true vocation: biology. At Christ’s College, he was introduced to the world of geology, botany and entomology, something that would mark his brilliant professional career.</p>
          <h3 class="sub">Professional life</h3>
          <p>It was still at Christ’s College that Darwin was offered something that would change everything. Thanks to his friendship with a Reverend from Cambridge, he was given the opportunity to embark on a journey around the world. The reverend introduced him to Robert Fitz Roy, captain of the famous "Beagle", the ship with which they were going to make the crossing.</p>
          <p>
        In 1831, the "Beagle" sailed from the port of Davenport, in England. On board there was a young Darwin, barely 22 years old, who had the function of working as a naturalist during the expedition. An expedition that, despite the fact that it was supposed to last two years, did not end until five years later.</p>
          <p>During this time, Darwin and the rest of the crew traveled around the world, exploring South America, the Galapagos, Cape Verde, New Zealand, Tahiti, Australia, South Africa ... Darwin was studying the species of both animals and plants with the that they were bumping into each other and, thanks to her special attention to detail, she began to realize their similarities and differences.</p>
          <p>
        Once aboard the "Beagle", Darwin suspected that the belief we had about the stability of species over time might not be correct, since he observed, among other things, that the further away the species were, the more different they were between them, and that they were very adapted to the conditions of the environment in which they lived, as if they had characteristics according to their needs.</p>
          <p>When he returned to England he was already a reputed naturalist, although he was still nothing compared to what the future held. Taking up his observations made during the voyage, Darwin began to work on "The Origin of Species", the book where he presented the conclusions of his research.</p>
          <p>Its publication was quite a stir, as it stated that species evolve according to natural selection, that is, that those organisms that can more easily survive in a medium, more offspring with their characteristics will leave and, therefore, the species will tend to adopt its properties.</p>
          <p>
        This was adopted by some as the most important scientific work in the history of biology, although some ecclesiastical sectors tried to demonize it as it attacked the deepest base of religion. God did not indicate the course of the history of living beings. It was natural selection. Darwin divided the world into "Evolutionists" and "Creationists."</p>
          <p>Finally, Darwin died of heart disease in 1882, leaving behind the foundations that allow us today to understand life and evolution as we do.</p>

            The 4 main contributions of Charles Darwin to science</h2>
          <ol class="sub">
            <li>Species do not remain static over time, they evolve</li>
            <p>It had always been thought that the species we see now were the same since the appearance of life. However, Darwin showed that organisms do not stop changing, so that species are something dynamic.</p>
            <li>Natural selection is the mechanism that enables evolution</li>
            <p>The theory of natural selection postulates that if you are not adapted to the environment, you will die before those who are better adapted, so the population of that species will tend to have the characteristics of the most “benefited” genetically speaking.</p>
            <li>All living beings start from a common ancestor</li>
            <p>Darwin observed that all the animals he investigated had some characteristics in common, which were more striking the closer they were in space. The farther apart, the fewer characteristics they shared.</p>
            <li>End of anthropocentrism</li>
            <p>
        Darwin put an end to the idea that humans are something special in the Universe. He said that we were just another animal that is affected by the laws of natural selection like all other living things. This caused fright in the Church, because it was the previous step to showing that humans come from the monkey, something that is perfectly accepted today but that in its day was a real revolution.</p>
